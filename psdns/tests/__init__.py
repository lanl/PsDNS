"""Unit testing for PsDNS

PsDNS uses Python :mod:`unittest` for several purposes:

  1. Conventional unit testing.
  2. Parallel scaling tests.
  3. Formal code verification.

For this reason, some of the tests are longer than typical for pure
unit testing.  Users may prefer to run only subsets of the complete
test suites, depending on what they want to test.

For code verification and scaling tests, the unit test code may output
plots.  These are put in the directory specified by
:attr:`TestCase.testdir`.

To run the full suite directly from the source directory::

  PYTHONPATH=. python -m unittest -v

To run a specific set of tests, provide the name of the tests, e.g.::

  PYTHONPATH=. python -m unittest -v psdns.tests.test_fft

The scaling tests will only run if run with MPI and sufficient tasks
are allocated.  On most systems the syntax is::

  PYTHONPATH=. mpirun -np 8 python -m unittest -v psdns.tests.test_scalings

The :mod:`~psdns.tests` module includes a customized :class:`TestCase`
class for use in PsDNS tests.
